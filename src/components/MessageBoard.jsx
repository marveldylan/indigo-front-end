            <h3>Welcome, traveler</h3>
            <h4>What is this?</h4>
            <p>project_indigo is a new kind of social media platform that connects builders, creatives, hobbysts, explorers, enthusiasts, professionals and amateurs to share knowledge and build communities around collective skills and passions. We're interested in taking infotainment to a whole new level, with professional and user-created channels, content, and tutorials on everything from audio engineering to how to string a tennis racket. We believe knowledge is power, and we want to create a curated, organized platform that empowers our users to explore new horizons, ask for help on projects, and learn new skills. Best of all, everything is free; universal access is core to our beliefs, and we believe everyone should be allowed the tools to better themselves. While you can most certainly find most of the information on this site in other places on the web, we hope to bring you a cohesive environment where you can easily search, save, and connect on a wide variety of topics and content, rather than digging deep for YouTube tutorials or shelling out hard earned cash for courses or subscriptions that might not even be worthwile. Let us be your launch pad, your community hangout, your work bench, your whetstone, your dream machine. We're still experimenting with project_indigo, and we're excited to see how you use it!</p>
            <h4>Who Are We?</h4>
            <p>At our core, project_indigo is a rag-tag bunch of goons that like to learn. We aim to be a positive force, and create a social media experience that focuses on interesting content facilitating personal growth, rather than . . . well, mindless junk. We hope for users to build meaningful connections with others who share their passions, and explore new things too!</p>
